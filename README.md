# Challenge-1---Accessibility
Challenge 1 Submission - Due 09/01

This Challenge is going to focus on the accessibility aspects of the main source code. None of the code is mine, nor do I claim that it is. My goal is to add accessibility features for users with disabilities, those that may be using screenreaders, as well as potential Search Engine Optimization features.
